# STATE: TFT Local Copilot

**Project:** TFT Local Copilot
**Last updated:** 2026-04-23

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** A TFT player can ask comp questions, patch notes, augment choices, or pivot strategies — and get grounded, locally-sourced answers without leaving the game ecosystem. **v1.4 transforms this from a search tool into an intelligent knowledge companion.**

**Current Milestone:** v1.4 Smart & Polished — in progress

---

## Current Position

**Active Phase:** Phase 11 complete — Knowledge Graph (KNOW-01..04) ✅

**Phase 11 Status:** Complete — 486 nodes, 500 edges, 23 tests passing

**Milestone Progress:**
```
✅ v1.0 MVP — Phases 1-7 (shipped 2026-04-22)
✅ v1.1 TFT Meta Mastery — Phase 8 (shipped 2026-04-22)
✅ v1.2 MetaTFT Real-time Intelligence — Phase 9 (shipped 2026-04-23)

## v1.4 "Smart & Polished" — Vision

### Problem Statement

The current system answers questions but doesn't *understand* TFT entities. It retrieves text chunks, not structured knowledge. Three concrete pain points:

1. **Flat responses:** "What items for Briar?" returns a wall of text. Not structured, not cross-linked.
2. **UI overflow:** Long messages stretch the container, breaking layout alignment.
3. **Sparse knowledge:** Only 32 chunks in the DB. 252 augments and 59 champions are not in the vector store.

### Key Design Decisions for v1.4

| Decision | Rationale | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| NetworkX for knowledge graph | Fast, Python-native, easy to serialize | ✅ Planned (Phase 11) |
| Entity JSON markers in LLM output | No prompt overhead, easy to parse | ✅ Planned (Phase 13) |
| Knowledge Graph as primary for entity queries | Graph traversal is faster than vector search for direct entity lookups | ✅ Planned (Phase 13) |
| Tailwind-only CompCard | Replace inline styles for maintainability | ✅ Planned (Phase 12) |
| Streaming citations (SSE events) | Progressive reveal improves perceived latency | ✅ Planned (Phase 14) |

## Known Issues

### UI Issues (To Fix in Phase 12)

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Message bubble overflow | No `max-width` enforcement + missing `min-w-0` on flex containers | UI-01 |
| CitationCard truncates | `line-clamp-3` + no expand state | UI-02 |
| CompCard inline styles | Mixed inline/Tailwind, hard to maintain | UI-03 |
| No mobile layout | No responsive breakpoints | UI-04 |
| Poor streaming UX | Basic typing indicator, no progressive reveal | UI-05 |

### Security (Acknowledged)

- ⚠️ **RLS disabled on DB tables** — accepted risk for local-only deployment

---

## Session Continuity

### For Next Session

When starting v1.4 Phase 11:
1. Run health checks:
   ```powershell
   ollama ps
   npx supabase status
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/gpu
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/patch/status
   ```
2. Verify the 7 verified data files are in the project root
3. Start Phase 11 with `$gsd-plan-phase 11`

### What v1.4 Changes

| Before v1.4 | After v1.4 |
|-------------|-------------|
| Text chunks in DB (~44) | Structured chunks by entity type (500+) |
| Flat markdown text responses | Rich entity cards (ChampionProfile, ItemCard, TraitCard, AugmentCard) |
| Keyword search | Knowledge graph traversal + vector search hybrid |
| Citation cards at end of response | Streaming citations that appear progressively |
| Single-column layout, overflow bugs | Responsive layout with proper overflow handling |
| 3 modes (Normal/RAG/Coach) | Same 3 modes, but each delivers smarter, cross-linked answers |
| 32 ingested TFT data chunks | 500+ chunks covering all Set 17 entities |
